# Sudoku Solver Visualizer

## Overview
The Sudoku Solver Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to help users solve Sudoku puzzles while visualizing the solving process. It aids in understanding the logical steps involved in solving Sudoku and provides insights into different problem-solving strategies.

## Goals

### Educational Goals
- **Understand Algorithm Implementation:** Gain a deep understanding of the backtracking algorithm and its application in solving Sudoku puzzles.
- **Improve Logical Reasoning:** Enhance your logical thinking and problem-solving skills by breaking down complex problems into smaller steps.
- **Learn Visualization Techniques:** Develop skills in creating visual representations of algorithms to make them easier to understand.

### Development Goals
- **Build a Functional Application:** Develop a fully functional Sudoku solver visualizer that can accept user input and solve puzzles efficiently.
- **Implement User-Friendly Interface:** Design an intuitive and interactive user interface that allows easy input and visualization of the solving process.
- **Ensure Robust Error Handling:** Implement error checking to ensure the puzzle setup is valid and provide meaningful feedback to users.

## Specifications

### Functional Requirements

#### Solver Functionality:
- The application should implement a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle.
- The solver should provide a step-by-step visualization of the solving process.

#### Controls:
- Buttons for solving, and speed control the solving process.
- A ‘Load Puzzle’ button to clear the puzzle and load a new one.
- A ‘Change Theme’ button to change the theme of the visualizer.

### Understanding the Algorithm

#### Backtracking Basics:
- The backtracking algorithm tries to fill in the Sudoku grid one cell at a time.
- It places a number in an empty cell and checks if it complies with Sudoku rules.
- If a placement leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks to the previous cell and tries the next possible number.

#### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Step 1:** Start with the first empty cell.
2. **Step 2:** Place the smallest possible number (1-9) that does not violate Sudoku rules.
3. **Step 3:** Move to the next empty cell and repeat step 2.
4. **Step 4:** If no valid number can be placed, backtrack to the previous cell and try the next number.
5. **Step 5:** Continue this process until the grid is completely filled or no solution is found.

## [Code Example] (./src/SudokuSolverGUI.java)

## Code Overview

The `SudokuSolverGUI` class includes the following components:

- **GUI Setup:** Uses Swing components to create the Sudoku grid and control buttons.
- **Puzzle Initialization:** Randomly selects and loads a puzzle from a predefined set.
- **Solving Mechanism:** Implements a backtracking algorithm to solve the Sudoku puzzle with visual updates.
- **Control Buttons:** Provides functionalities to load a new puzzle, start/stop solving, change solving speed, and switch themes.

## Key Components

### GUI Setup

#### Grid Layout:
- The main Sudoku grid is divided into 3x3 subgrids, each containing 3x3 cells.
- Each cell is a `JTextField` for user input and display.

#### Control Panel:
- Buttons for loading a puzzle, solving, stopping the solver, and changing the theme.
- A `JComboBox` for selecting the solving speed.

### Puzzle Initialization

#### Predefined Puzzles:
- The class contains an array of predefined puzzles.
- A random puzzle is selected and loaded into the grid upon initialization or when the "Load Puzzle" button is clicked.

### Solving Mechanism

#### Backtracking Algorithm:
- The `solve()` method implements the backtracking algorithm.
- The algorithm fills the grid step-by-step, checking the validity of each number placement.
- Includes a delay mechanism to visualize each step.
